# merge-logs
#### info
This is my first Ruby program because I want to use this at work and learn Ruby at the same time.

#### usage
Place two logs named file1.log and file2.log and the program will take these files and merge them together using the timestamp as long as the timestamp is the format 2015-07-03 16:16:16,131 to change this edit the regular expression to your prefereded timestamp.
